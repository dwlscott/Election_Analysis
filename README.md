## Conclusion: 
As the election comes to a close, and we congratulate the winner. What was asked of us in the audit allowed us to give clear and cohesive results.  It's just one of the many benefits that our services allows us to do. The script that we used maybe simple, yet, it’s mighty. It can be manipulated in many ways, that can be beneficial for future election performances. Those include broadening or narrowing the parameters of the election results. Which could cover each candidate's financial statistics. To show how each one managed their budget, and how that translated into the votes they received. Another parameter could be, the type of demographic that each candidate was targeting, and how that swayed or altered their votes received. 

These are just a few examples, as stated before, there are so many possibilities that can be provided. Knowledge is a powerful thing, and the data is here to help. Who’s to say that whoever you are representing in the future, might want to take it past the local level... A few changes here, and there to the script could be an advantage.

Ultimately, we are here to help. Please let us know if you need any further assistance, and we would be more than happy to consult, and figure out what best suits your needs.
